         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

They that grow cunning in the Booke of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by reading Gods and good Mens Books, are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the beſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the beſt Lawyers to pleade their owne Cauſe, and the beſt Iudges to Iudge of themſelues aright.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:14165:10"/>
            <p>This book is of Gods own hand writing; it is alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry legible to any that will giue themſelues to reade it.</p>
            <p>If we open this booke, marke it, and conſider well what it aduiſeth, what is it that ſhall not then be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? It is the faſhion of people generally to cry out of the world, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners thereof, in the meane ſpace they know not the cauſe, or will not know it, and yet is it neere them, and within them; and that is the badneſſe of mens Conſciences. For amend theſe, and the world ſhall not be blamed; for as mens conſciences be ſo is it alſo: reforme theſe and reforme it; better them, and the World will bee good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<pb facs="tcp:14165:10"/> and the complaint will ceaſe.</p>
            <p>Conſcience as it is good or euill, ſo it makes or mars a man: by a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he becomes good, thinks, deſires, affecteth, and ſpeaketh of good things; and doth them: by a bad Conſcience hee turneth a cleane contrary courſe: For as our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences be, euen ſo are we: if it be naught, we are vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, we are vaine, lewd and naught too: if it be good, we fly from ſinne as from a ſerpent, and feare to offend God and our Neighbour.</p>
            <p>Conſcience is appointed by God to bee our carefull watchman, to eye vs well, to record all our thoughts, ſayings, and doings, &amp; ſo to
<pb facs="tcp:14165:11"/> witneſſe againſt or with vs vnto God, when he ſhall call vs to an account. It at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth when God ſhall ſummon us; then will it plead hard, howſoeuer it ſeemeth now to be ſilent in moſt.</p>
            <p>By Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience we become well acquainted with our ſelues, elſe to our ſelues we remaine meere ſtrangers; for nothing within vs but it can make vs to know our ſelues, which is the moſt excellent point of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. To ſee themſelues many looke into glaſſes; Let us looke then into this glaſſe of Conſcience, that we may ſee our ſelues, and that not only in ſome outward part, as by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall glaſſe we do, but
<pb facs="tcp:14165:11"/> by this alſo as well inward as outward. By the artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all a man may ſee himſelfe, and ſoone forget what manner of one he was; but this will not only ſhew vs what we bee, but will alſo keepe vs in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our ſelues, that in no buſineſſe we ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get our ſelues.</p>
            <p>Conſcience is a thing ſo diuine, and hath ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God, as it can and will tel vs whether God be with vs or againſt vs, whether he be friend or foe, and how our caſe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth betweene him and vs: which to know, is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and behoouefull, as all knowledge in reſpect of this is but vaine, and in the end to little purpoſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:14165:12"/>
            <p>Conſcience next vnder God, is that to which we may moſt ſafely commend and commit our ſelues, our whole eſtate, the diſpoſing and ordering of all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires: It is a good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour to vs aliue, and a moſt faithfull Executer of our laſt will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, left in other mens hands for our Children and poſterity.</p>
            <p>Conſcience is onely that which will and can make vs honeſt men, and of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit among men: for as our Conſcience is knowne to be, ſo are we reputed, and ſo ſhall we be truſted. It is that which alwaies wee muſt bring with vs for our ſuretie in all promiſes, contracts, and bargaines, or
<pb facs="tcp:14165:12"/> elſe none will credit vs. The word of Conſcience, when it is once knowne, wil procure vs more credit, then we for the preſent are worth. The honeſty of it is aboue all bonds: It will carrie great matters in few words, when without it by many words we ſhall not be truſted for trifles: For Conſcience will not giue it word for any diſhoneſt man, though clothed in ſilk and ſatten, yea, though he haue Lands and large reuenues, Conſcience will not be bound for him. It onely will be ſurety for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men, whom it both may vrge, and will make them keep day with others punctually.</p>
            <p>As for Time ſeruers,
<pb facs="tcp:14165:13"/> looſe companions, ſhifting Fellowes, Hypocrites, cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Merchants, and irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons: it will haue nothing to do with them; which appeareth by this, for that it forbiddeth ſuch to vſe their wits to coozen and to defraud one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But for whom it once giueth its word, it is ſtill calling on them, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to remember honeſty, equitie, fidelitie, and to doe as they would be done vnto.</p>
            <p>Conſcience is the chiefeſt maintainer of iuſtice and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity among men: And men generally are content with what it decreeth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, and alloweth, as may appeare by ſuch ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as theſe, <hi>In Conſcience
<pb facs="tcp:14165:13"/> giue what you thinke fit; I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to your Conſcience in this and that: betweene God and your Conſcience be it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From Conſcience do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe all the commendations of all our actions, or the diſcommendations. If any do ill, ſtraightway Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is queſtioned, <hi>Is this your Conſcience? Can you do this of your Conſcience?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſcience is a mans beſt friend, or his worſt foe, in trouble &amp; diſtreſſe, here in this life, at death, and at the laſt iudgement. It will ſpeake with or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a man, as the cauſe requireth; It pleads with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fee; it reſpects no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, be he Poore or Rich. It will ſide with none, it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the death partiality,
<pb facs="tcp:14165:14"/> lying, equiuocating, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and all falſhood.</p>
            <p>Conſcience is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of charity, of faith, of truth, and of vprightneſſe; It is the Caske wherein to keep the miſtery of faith and true godlineſſe: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which all theſe periſh. A man making ſhipwracke of Conſcience loſeth all power of religion, of which he hath no more, then he maketh Conſcience of.</p>
            <p>Conſcience, is that whoſe aduiſe a man muſt firſt take in all his actions, before he vndertakes to do them. For if it be either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, or oppoſed, or careleſly ſlighted, the act will turne to ſinne.</p>
            <p>Conſcience in a word is Gods Record, out of which
<pb facs="tcp:14165:14"/> hee will take notice of euery man: and as there he finds him, ſo will he iudge him, and thereafter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſentence, either of abſolution or condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>And therefore by this ſo large an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> (Right worſhipfull) you may ſee how it is not onely fit, but very neceſſarie alſo to be acquainted with Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; which in moſt is without all authority to bind them to the good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior, ſo looſely, ſo licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly do moſt men liue. But bleſſed be God, that you haue better learned Chriſt, and haue felt the commanding power of the word, and the comfort of a good Conſcience by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:14165:15"/> your ſelues Patternes to that your wel reformed Family; In which true pie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie is attended vpon with loue vnfaigned one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, and your profeſſion adorned with workes of charitie abroad. Your frequent reading of holy Scriptures, I well know, affords you exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples not a few of holie du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but you want not a rare preſident at home, that moſt honorable Ladie Marchioneſſe, your noble Mother. Whoſe ſingular humility, great bountie, deſire to pleaſe God, loue to his word in the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full plainneſſe thereof, and performance of good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are much to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red eſpecially in ſo great a
<pb facs="tcp:14165:15"/> Perſonage, in one ſo verie aged &amp; full of daies, in one ſo long brought vp in her former yeares in the moſt eminent place of royall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnder that famous Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> I hope I need not to ſtirre your readie minds to a thankfull acknowledging to God of this and other his mercies, nor to excite you to ſtriue for the euerlaſting hope of bleſſedneſſe; ſeeing that your iuſtifying Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, accompanying your iuſtifying faith, as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, giueth you good aſſurance in your waies of well doing. For your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie continuance wherein, I am bold in this ample man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to preſent vnto your courteous acceptance the
<pb facs="tcp:14165:16"/> excellencie of Conſcience and to commend the ſame to your Chriſtian medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And ſo I humblie take leaue, in my heartie prayers commending that right Honourable Lady, with your worthy Selues, beloued Children, and all your religious houſhold to the fauour and guidance of the Almighty; euer reſting,</p>

It is an other thing created of God, beſides all theſe in mans ſoule. Firſt, none that write of it, doe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14165:23"/> make them one with it. Secondly, the holy Ghoſt by his Pen-men, giues it a diſtinct name from the reſt. Thirdly, it hath differing properties from them all, as ſhall appeare by the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof in this Treatiſe. Fourthly, Man hath a kind of power (as I may ſay) ouer the reſt, to ſet his minde a working, to inuent this, or that; ſo his Memory to keepe; his Will to approue, or diſallow. But Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſuch a thing, as hee cannot worke it to his will and pleaſure: It commands him; he hath no rule ouer it, to make it ſpeake, or bee ſilent when he liſt. Fiftly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> plainely putteth a difference betweene the Mind and Conſcience, <hi>Tit.</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:14165:24"/> 1. 15. and betweene it and the heart, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it hath ſuch an ouer-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling power, ouer Men and Diuels, as it neither is, nor can be awed by any, but onely by God himſelfe; and therefore muſt bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged ſome diſtinct thing from the reſt.</p>

               <p>In the <hi>Will</hi> it is, when it makes it Will what it ought, and to Will the contrarie.

               </p>
               <p>Thus wee ſee Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence not to be confined to any part of the ſoule, but worketh euery where in it.

               <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="1">1. The law of nature is mentioned, Rom. 2. 12. 14. of which a Principle is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by Chriſt. Mat. 7. 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The precepts of the Morall Law are repeated, Matth. 19. 18. 19. Rom. 13. 9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are expounded in the new Teſtament more ſpiritually, and that by our Sauiour Chriſt, Matth. 5. 21. 27. 28. 33. 34. 37.</p>
                  <p>So as this Rule and Law of God, in Nature, in the Decalogue, and in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, is one and the ſame; the firſt written in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14165:48"/> heart, Rom. 2. 15, the ſame written in Tables of ſtone more fully, and expounded by the Prophets; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine written in the heart of thoſe with whom God makes his new Couenant of grace, 2. Cor. 3. 3. Ier. 31. 33. Heb. 8. 10. So as they differ not, but in degree of a more large expoſition of one an other; as thus,</p>
                  <p>The Law in Nature ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery;</hi> the Decalogue goeth further, and ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not couet thy Neighbours wife:</hi> then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a more ſpirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition thereof in the Goſpell, and ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not looke vpon a woman to luſt after her;</hi> for he that ſo doth, hath committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14165:48"/> with her already in his heart. So the Law in Nature ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not murther;</hi> the Decalogue ſaith alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill;</hi> but the Goſpell extends it to anger, rayling ſpeeches); Matth. 5. 22, and telleth vs plainely, that hee that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his brother is a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, 1.

                  <p>Though the ſenſe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, yet the Law is one and the ſame; and this is the Rule which guideth and bindeth Conſcience, properly and immediately from God.</p>
                  <p>Mans Law alſo bindeth Conſcience; for obedience is due for <hi>Conſcience ſake,</hi> Rom. 13. 5. that is, for the <hi>Lords ſake,</hi> 1. Pet. 2. 13. So farre, as the Lawes of men

               <p>COnſcience muſt needs haue much to doe; for it hath many offices, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt is to bee <hi>Mans Ouer-ſeer</hi> By the helpe of the Vnderſtanding it is the eye, looking thorow the whole Man, within and without: him, for his thoughts, words, &amp; deeds. This is the Lords Candle, ſearching all the inward parts of the belly, Prou. 20. 27. But how is this? By beholding the Rule with the Act, as before is noted: for by this, <hi>Dauids</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14165:58"/> expreſſed by the word <hi>reines,</hi> taught him, Pſalm. 16. 7. 8. ſetting the Lord, that is, his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements before him, as the Rule for direction. The Rule and Act ſeene toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the very life of Conſcience: theſe two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make Conſcience, as body and ſoule make a Man.</p>
               <p>If theſe be feuered, Man is not led by Conſcience, but by ſome other thing, as <hi>Senſe, Will, Appetite, Fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Imagination, examples of other, cuſtome, commands, counſell and aduiſe of men;</hi> or by <hi>Satans ſuggeſtion</hi> delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and beguiling.</p>
               <p>Remember this Ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer, this Eye, if I may ſo ſay, of God within vs; for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14165:58"/> what it ſeeth, God ſeeth; we care to hide ourwayes from men; but we cannot couer them from our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, which will be as a thouſand witneſſes one day, and now here behold vs as we be.</p>

               <p>COnſcience ſeeing, and diligently obſeruing Man in all his courſes open and ſecret, within him and without him; it then <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints himſelfe with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe</hi> making him to ſee, and know himſelfe to bee truly that which indeed hee is,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14165:59"/> by beholding the Rule with his actions. The glaſſe without the eye ſeeing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, cannot ſhew to a man his countenance; nor the eye, if the glaſſe bee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; but both together: So is it in this; the eye of Conſcience beholding the Rule, and reflecting vpon mans thoughts, words, and deeds, it tells him plainely betweene God and him, that hee is honeſt or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, chaſte or vncleane, mercifull or a niggard, compaſſionate or hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, humble or proud, vpright or fraudulent, eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreated or reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>Therefore learne truly of thy Conſcience what thou art, and how thy ſtate
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14165:59"/> ſtands betweene God and thee. Reſt not vpon thy conceit, nor vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of thy Neighbours, neither vpon mens flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, nor vpon mens euill ſpeeches; but goe to the plaine dealing of thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience looking to the Rule, and what it ſaith that belieue to be true, whether it ſpeake well or ill. For it feares not to tell thee the truth, it cannot flatter, lye, nor cogge, neither will it ſlander thee, nor lay any thing to thy charge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly: but as the Rule and Act agree, ſo will it tell thee what thou art in Gods preſence.</p>

               <p>COnſcience playing the part of a true friend, and not of a flatterer, and diſcouering man to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe concerning his waies, either good or euill, in the next place it becomes to be his <hi>Director and Teacher,</hi> as <hi>Dauids</hi> Conſcience taught him, Pſalm. 16. 7. It is like a good Schoole-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, teaching and well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his Schollers.</p>
               <p>Now this office of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is exerciſed, as a Guide &amp; Director, in three things, either commanded, or forbidden, or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>

In which place the Knowledge informeth &amp; ſaith, <hi>This is the way;</hi> then the Conſcience ſtirreth and ſets Man forward, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Walke in it.</hi> Thus did it with <hi>Pilate,</hi> who was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that Chriſt was righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, that he of enuy was deliuered to him; yea alſo he himſelfe found nothing in Chriſt worthy of death; therfore his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to do him iuſtice,

                  <p>1. That it be expedient and profitable, 1. Cor. 6. 12. and 10. 23. 2. That it bee not to the loſſe of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an libertie, to bee brought vnder the power thereof, 1. Cor. 6. 12. 3. That wee become not an offence, Rom. 14. 20. or a ſtumbling blocke to the weake, and cauſe them by our example to be emboldened to doe that, which otherwiſe their conſcience doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue of, Rom. 14. 13. 1. Cor. 8. 9. 10. 13. this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the wounding of their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14165:62"/> conſcience, 1. Cor. 8. 12. 4. That the thing tend to edifying; that is, to inſtruct and further others in the ſtudy of pietie, and of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, Ro. 14. 19. 1. Cor. 10. 23. 5. That it bee for decency and order, 1. Cor. 14. 40. 6. That it tend to peace, not grieuing others, to make them to ſpeake euill, Rom. 14. 15. 1. Cor. 10. 16. 30. 7. And laſtly, that God may thereby bee glorified, 1. Cor. 10. 31.</p>
                  <p>To theſe Rules Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath an eye in the vſe of things indifferent; of which, in reſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, no queſtion for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake ſhould bee made, 1.

                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:14165:64"/> therof, according to which it warrants or inhibits vs. Thus it dealt with <hi>Paul,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him libertie to pleaſe all men (in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different) to gaine ſome to God, 1. Cor. 10. 33. but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, when it ſhould offend any good Chriſtian, then it reſtrained him, though the matter in it ſelfe was very indifferent, 1. Cor. 8. 13. Rom. 14. 21.</p>
                  <p>Thus wee ſee how Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience directeth in all theſe three; yet not at all times alike, no not in the beſt: and with ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in men, as in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion they be quicke or ſlow, or ſound of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or weake to iudge: for thereafter doth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience more or leſſe moue
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14165:64"/> to well doing, or more or leſſe reſtraine and bridle from euill.</p>
                  <p>Seeing this is the act of Conſcience in all theſe, let vs hearken thereunto: and doe what we doe for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, that is, becauſe our Conſcience dictates to vs our dutie herein from the Lord, Ro. 13. 5. 1. Pet. 2. 13.</p>
                  <p>If this be ſo, then hence may bee reproued, Firſt, ſuch as regard not Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence direction, neither in things commanded, nor forbidden, but liue as void of all Conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch as hearken to it ſometime, and in ſome things; but in other things, at ſome other time regard it not. Thirdly, ſuch as
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14165:65"/> thinke Conſcience to haue nothing to doe in things indifferent, and therefore doe they take what liberty they liſt herein, not caring to be offenſiue, &amp; to grieue others: but let ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe things: Firſt, that the Apoſtle hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Rules herein, which Conſcience binds vnto. Secondly, that hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds his owne example, as one ſtrictly obſeruing the ſame. Thirdly, that he preſſeth the keeping of the Rule, 1. Corint. 10. 28. 29. Fourthly, that hee diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the careleſſe breach of the Rules, Rom. 14. and 1. Cor. 8. &amp; 10. And thus much for the third act and office of Conſcience: which too many are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

               <p>COnſcience, vpon it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of man, doth obſerue him well, whether he doth obey, or diſobey, and thereafter ſets downe both his obedience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and ſo it becomes <hi>Gods Regiſter or Notarie,</hi> to keepe in record all things which man doth here in the body, whether it bee good or euill, againſt the Iudgement Day, where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count muſt bee made of all
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14165:66"/> things, ſecret as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, 2. Cor. 5. 10. Eccleſ. 12. 14.</p>
               <p>Thus is Conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually exerciſed, though it ſeeme to be dead, and to ſay nothing: for this muſt we know, <hi>That though Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience bee not euer ſpeaking to Rebels againſt God, yet is it euer writing.</hi> Therfore hath it the name of a booke, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel. 20. 12. in which God will haue ſet downe all things. By this is it, that God will ſet all wicked mens ſinnes before euery one of them in order, Pſal. 50. 21. Of this writing ſpeakes <hi>Iob,</hi> Chap. 13. 26. who thereby was made to behold the ſinnes of his youth: by this, after many yeeres, the Patriarches did
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14165:66"/> ſee their owne enuy, their vnnaturall cruelty to their brother, Gen. 42. 21. for time blots out no ſinne, but repentance, and pardon from heauen.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore now learne to take heed what we doe; for God hath ſet a Spie ouer vs to watch our wayes, and to note them downe, all our thoughts, affections, inclinations, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, reſolutions, words and deeds, to remember vs of them before God, when he ſhall pleaſe to call vs to an account.</p>
               <p>As this is terrible to the wicked vpon due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his manifold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils; ſo is it comfortable to ſuch as liue godly, for their well-doing is written

                  <p>THis act of Conſcience is called excuſing, Ro. 2. 15. and in witneſſing for vs it hath reſpect both to time and thing.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For time, either paſt, or preſent, or to come: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning time paſt, we ſee an example in <hi>Iob,</hi> whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by the helpe of Memory, witneſſed many good things for him, Chap. 23. 11. 12. and 29 12. 17. So likewiſe in <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> Gen. 40. 15. and in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 23. 1. and in the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1. Sam. 12. 3. for what they ſpake for their
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14165:68"/> iuſtification, it was vttered by the warrant of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſuch holy men: and not from an impudency of face, as the wicked doe.</p>
                  <p>For the time preſent, we haue an example in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who had his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence witneſſing with him for his preſent eſtate, 1. Cor. 4. 4. for his words, and alſo for the inward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart, Ro. 9. 1. 2. The like wee haue in <hi>Peter</hi> after his fall, whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, after repentance vnfained, made him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to Chriſt touching his loue: his conſcience encouraged him to ſay to Chriſt, Thou knoweſt that I loue thee, Ioh. 21. 15. 16. 17.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee how Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:14165:68"/> witneſſeth for vs for time paſt and preſent. Some mens conſciences may beare witneſſe for the time paſt, as <hi>Hymeneus,</hi> and <hi>Alexanders,</hi> and <hi>Demas</hi> might; but not for the preſent, becauſe they fell away. But a <hi>Pauls</hi> conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will witneſſe for the time paſt, and time preſent too, 2. Tim. 1. 3. Heb. 13. 18.</p>
                  <p>Touching the time to come, conſcience is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſilent: not that it can witneſſe for vs, what wee yet neuer thought, ſpake, or did; but, in reſpect of our reſolution for the time to come, it can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with vs, that wee doe reſolue to doe well, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour it, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes,

                  <p n="2">2. For the thing it beares vs witnes of, which is both for matter &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For <hi>matter, Nehemiah</hi> his conſcience ſtood for him, Nehem. 13. 14. 22. for <hi>manner,</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> in his teaching, 2.

               <p>WHen Conſcience hath eyed well Man, made him acquainted with himſelfe, written downe his thoughts, his doings, and ſayings, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or excuſed him, then it ſits downe, as a iuſt Iudge of Oyer and Terminer, to heare and determine, to giue ſentence, againſt which there is no appeale to be made.</p>
               <p>This ſentence is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, either to acquite and abſolue, or to bind and condemne, Rom. 14. 22. 1. Co. 11. 31. 1. Ioh. 3. 20. 21.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:14165:74"/>
               <p>In condemning, it makes him ſee his ſinne, and ſo cauſeth him to thinke and ſpeake baſely of himſelfe, and of his ill deeds, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> did; I haue done very fooliſhly, 2. Sam. 24. 10. and was as a beaſt, Pſal. 73. 22. and to confeſſe with the prodigall ſonne, that he is vnworthy to bee called Gods childe, Luk. 15. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it will make him apply, as iuſtly deſerued, the hand of God againſt him, as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> did, Chap. 1. 12. and <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2. Sam. 24 17. and withall to acknowledge the Lord to be righteous, as did <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> 2. Chron. 12. 6.</p>
               <p>In abſoluing it doth not reproach a man, Iob 27. 6. but doth make him ſtand
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14165:75"/> vpon his innocency (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is guiltleſſe) as it did <hi>Dauid</hi> againſt <hi>Sauls</hi> malice, enuy, and falſe accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>This Iudge let vs take notice of, and labour for abſolution from it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of its ſentence of condemnation, for God will ſecond it; who is greater then thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, 1. Ioh. 3. 20.</p>

                  <label>Anſw.</label> By the effect and worke of it vpon the heart preſently vpon the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence giuen.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it acquite, then it will make the heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, 2. Cor. 1. 12. It will comfort him againſt all

               <p n="2">2. If it condemne, then the heart is made ſad and ſorrowfull, as it was in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das:</hi> then it workes ſhame, Gen. 3. feare, Wiſd. 17. 11. trembling in a <hi>Felix,</hi> and horrour in <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> Dan. 5. 6. &amp; diſquiets the whole

               <p n="1">1. To be a witneſſe for God, in his iuſt proceeding againſt man, to enforce him to ſay, that God is iuſt.</p>

Thirdly, a God of mercy, that was pleaſed to giue vnto Man ſuch a truſty Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſer, and ſuch a faithfull Counſeller to direct him, if hee will be aduiſed and counſelled. 4. A God of iuſtice, that hath ſo ready a Tormenter in Man to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him, if needs hee will bee rebellious, and porſiſt in ſinne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To procure due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, and obedience to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14165:77"/> Gods commands, to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and worſhip, and to all his ordinances, which without this Conſcience Man corrupt would neuer doe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For Mans ſpeciall good ſundry wayes; as firſt, to make a Man to know himſelfe, and to ſee into himſelfe, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordering and diſpoſing of himſelfe towards God and Man. Secondly, to hearken vnto Gods word, and to make vſe thereof, inwardly and outwardly, in life &amp; conuerſation, which men would neuer doe, if they had no conſcience. Thirdly, to know how to apply to our ſelues Gods iudgements, with feare and awfulneſſe to his Maieſtie.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14165:77"/> Fourthly, to vphold hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſociety in families, in Townes, Cities, in Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="1">1. Is from Conſcience it ſelfe, which ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall hath loſt of it ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie, and commands but weakely in moſt, by reaſon of that hereditary corruption which ſtickes to it, as well as to the other faculties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is abuſe of the wit for mens priuate ends, which made <hi>Ahitophel</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Is wilfulneſſe, as in ſome Iſraelites, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 42. 43: and once in <hi>Dauid,</hi> when hee would number the people, 2. Sam. 24. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan

               <p n="4">4.

Worldly feare, the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the mighty will make a <hi>Pylate</hi> doe againſt his conſcience clearely conuicted, and conuicting him: Feare made <hi>Peter</hi> bar vp his conſcience from commanding him a while; Deſire of honour, and to keep a mans place in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<note place="margin">2.

                  <p>SVch as be blind in mind, and ſo haue a blind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, are miſerable, whoſe miſery may be liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet out by one that is bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily blind. This man, firſt, hath no direction by eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight; no more the other by conſcience. Secondly, He goeth whithen his will and affections lead him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſight, ſort his without conſcience. Thirdly, when he goeth whither hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth, by himſelfe, it is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14165:98"/> either by meere imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by hearſay, as he is told of others, or by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, through often go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or by feeling; ſo is it with him that hath a blind conſcience. His ſeruice to God is imaginary, or by tradition, or by cuſtome, but not by direction of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience ſeeing the rule, or from his feeling of Gods common fauours and outward bleſſings; which failing, they are at their wits end, and make an end of their deuotions. Fourthly, he needeth a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and is guided by him, but cannot iudge well of him: So the blind conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is led by his miniſter, or by others, but cannot iudge aright of them. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14165:99"/> he, tho in danger neere a pit, yet feares not, till hee be in: no more this, till he be in Hell. Sixthly, he wil, by others telling vntruly, feare, where no danger is; ſo this will be terrified by doctrines and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men, as blind Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts be. Seuenthly, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee his vncleaneneſſe, nor diſcerne how it is with him: no more can this, who thinks, through his blind conſcience, that all is well with him, hee is cleane e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.

They hold, that he which made all, will ſaue all; that Chriſt died alſo for all; that they doe what they can, and as farre as God wil giue them leaue, and more he will not require of them: that all ſinne, all are ſinners, euen the preciſeſt; the beſt doe amiſſe ſometime; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they need not make ſuch a doe to preuent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: that when they ſin, they cry God mercy, and hope therefore that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giues them; that when they ſinne in their mirth, they thinke no ill; that in

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14165:106"/> doe; that the Religion of the preſent State is to be ſo profeſſed; that to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, as ſome be, is but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foolery; that there is time to repent at laſt gaſpe.

               <p>That which makes this, is firſt, their knowledge of many and differing Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the World: Iewiſh, Turkiſh, and Chriſtian. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, their obſeruing of the varieties of Sects, and differing opinions in, and

               <p>THere is an euill large Conſcience, a ſpatious and wide Conſcience, like the way to Hell.</p>
               <p>This is the Conſcience of ſuch as can ſwallow downe ſinnes great and many; that can admit of cart-loades thereof, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any rub or let to this Conſcience. This is the conſcience of ſome world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, ſome of all ſorts of profeſſions, vſurers, extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of this ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſo large a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is the vnderſtanding highly eſteeming of profit
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14165:110"/> and preferment; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect hereof vnder-value<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and vnder-prizing of Religion, of iuſtice, and of vpright dealing.</p>
               <p>Whence followes ſinfull practiſes to gaine, and to come to aduancement, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing way to any ſinne that may hale in profit, make a man rich, and exalt his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in the World. No ſinne ſtickes in the way as ſinne, but onely for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy thereof, if openly knowne, or the danger of the Law, by which may enſue puniſhment: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, through largeneſſe of Conſcience, all is fiſh that comes to net, all is lawfull prey and booty, that may finely and cunningly bee come by.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:14165:110"/>
               <p>The <hi>remedie</hi> to bounde this wide conſcience is by tying it ſtrictly to the Rule of righteouſneſſe, and by vnderſtanding iuſtice, iudgment, equity, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Prou. 2. 9.</note> good path for our right dealing.</p>

               <p>This was the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Saul</hi> in his warfare<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:14165:112"/> to <hi>Baal;</hi> but hold vp the golden Calues in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> The Scribes and Phariſes had their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſtraite to put <hi>Iudas</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 6.</note> wages into the Treaſurie, and to goe into the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Hall: but it was<note place="margin">Ioh. 18. 28.</note> wide enough to giue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to betray Chriſt, and to cauſe <hi>Pilate</hi> to put him to death cauſeleſly.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14165:113"/> all. Scribes and Phariſies could tithe Mint, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min and Anniſe; but yet let paſſe the weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law.

               <p>
                  <hi>The Cauſe</hi> of ſuch a Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerill Conſcience is, Firſt, that a man makes the Rule of Conſcience ſubiect to his owne will, by falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, by ſubtill diſtinctions; thereby weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the power of the Rule, that it hath not force vpon Conſcience. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſecret and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall reſeruations in his minde and heart in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rule, to which hee
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14165:113"/> neuer wholly can, nor will ſubmit himſelfe. Thirdly, a deceitfull and very falſe imagination of minde, that the Rule is alterable, and may bee enlarged, as may beſt ſerue their turne, as Cardinall <hi>Cuſanus</hi> once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in a letter to the Bohemians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Remedy</hi> is, to hold the Rule euer to bee one and the ſame, impartiall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, vnalterable, without varying, as God himſelfe: alſo to be perſwaded, that we are to be wholly led by it, and not it to be framed to our owne luſts.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 31.</hi> Of the benumbed Conſcience.</head>
               <p>THe benumbed conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is that which hath loſt it mouing; as dead for a time, as a member benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</p>
               <p>This is the conſcience of ſuch as haue loſt the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereof by ſome foule offence, lying therein with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance. This may happen ſometime to the godly, to <hi>Ioſephs</hi> Brethren, to a <hi>Dauid</hi> for a while.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The cauſes</hi> hereof may bee expreſſed by a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude taken from a member benumbed. Firſt, A mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber becomes ſo, yea, the whole body after vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14165:114"/> heate and exerciſe by ſuddenly attracted cold. So a man very forward in Religion and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exerciſes, growing cold, by ſuddenly leauing them, liuing where the word is not, and company<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with others of no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or with contemners of it. Secondly, By a dead Palſey; So Conſcience by ſome deadly ſinne. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by tying it hard ſo as the bloud, wherein the life is, can haue no paſſage, till it be looſed; So Conſcience is benumbed, when the mind is tyed to the world ſo, as it cannot bee free to meditate vpon Gods word: for the freedome of the minde for holy meditation is as the life and bloud to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:14165:115"/> the Conſcience. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by ſome violent blow: So Conſcience by ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent ſuggeſtion of Satan, which for the preſent may make a man ſenſleſſe of his ſinning. Fifthly, by being put out of ioynt; So Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which is put, as I may ſay, out of ioynt, when memorie hath loſt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten what it ſhould keep; to carry it from the mind to the Conſcience, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things paſt, either of ſin committed, or of duty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. In this caſe, if me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory faile, the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Conſcience are put out of ioynt. Sixthly, a member becomes dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh by lying ſtill, but croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, vpon ſome hard thing, and weight vpon it,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14165:115"/> as the Arme will be, in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp the head, and the elbow vpon ſome hard bord, or other thing. So Conſcience is benumbed, when the vnderſtanding is crookedly bent to crooked paths, the heart hardened, and ſome heauie corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſſing it downe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The effect</hi> is, that, during this time that the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence lyeth as dead, the partie is without remorſe for ſinne; he cannot out of generall reproofes ſee his fall, without a liuely and cleare application, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in <hi>Dauid,</hi> when <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> ſpake to him paraboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Remedie</hi> is, to haue the word applyed, as a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> did it to <hi>Dauid;</hi> and to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14165:116"/> bee content to bee rubbed vpon by wholſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profes, priuat admonitions, and mutuall exhortations, that the heart be not harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the deceitfulneſſe<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 13.</note> of ſinne.</p>

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:14165:127"/> commanded, or forbidden, or about things indifferent.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

And therefore is he to preſſe his Conſcience with the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to yeeld obedience thereunto, and to force it by the cleare authority of it to do as God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or forbiddeth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If about things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, a man may not doe againſt his Conſcience; Rom. 14. 22. 23. Happy is hee (ſaith the Apoſtle) that

                  <p n="1">1. That God neither by his word foretels, nor by his prouidence doth prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticate either good or ill in the falling out of ſuch things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That albeit ſuch things happen according to mens vaine imaginations, yet no credit is to bee giuen
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:14165:133"/> thereto, nor any conſcience to be made thereof. Firſt, becauſe the opinion in theſe things is Heatheniſh, and from pagans, which Chriſtians are therefore to<note place="margin">Ier. 10. 1. 2.</note> deteſt, and not feare their feare. Secondly, becauſe Satan workes herein, and ſeekes to weaken our faith in God. Thirdly, becauſe theſe ſometime haue been found falſe, by religious mens true obſeruations; who contemne theſe fooleries. Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if they proue true ſometime, thats but to try vs, whether we wil be wiſe, or become vaine and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious. Laſtly, becauſe it is well obſerued, that the more naturall men be, and ignorant of the Goſpell,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:14165:134"/> the more fooliſhly ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious are they, the more fearefull and vaine in ſuch obſeruations, and the more inthraled in their minds to ſuch vanities.

                  <p>THe Conſcience of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man may haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a ſcruple in it, through ignorance or errour in ſome particular; but his Conſcience, for a ſcruple, is not to be called a ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Conſcience; for that which is ſcrupulous, is commonly, and for the moſt part ſo.</p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:14165:135"/>
                  <p>This happeneth, firſt, through the iudgment ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnſetled, vnreſolued, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, wauering this way and that way, ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, hauing no certaine ground to ſettle upon but onely running vpon conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, diſputing too and fro, with and againſt; ſo as Conſcience is much troubled.</p>
                  <p>2. This happeneth by miſapplying generall rules about things indifferent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they conceit, to particular actions: as to ſuppoſe, that they edifie not, that they be offenſiue, not decent, not to Gods glory: deciding within themſelues, ſometimes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiuely, that which an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes diſputable, by
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:14165:136"/> conference with whom their former concluſion is ſhaken, and ſo ſtand vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued in their iudgement.</p>
                  <p>3. This ſcruple happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, when a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent is needleſly queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle laboured to preuent among the Corinthians, ſaying, <hi>aske no queſtion for Conſcience ſake.</hi> 1.

For in truth there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that more breedeth ſcruple, than idle queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of matters, which might bee well paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
                  <p>4. By ſtretching a thing, for want of knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the nature of a thing indifferent, &amp; ſo taking it to be worſe than it is, through ſome ſhew of euill in his
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:14165:136"/> apprehenſion, as ſome did among the Corinthians. 1. Cor. 8. 7.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, by giuing way to doubts, and to trouble themſelues needleſly with vnprofitable diſputations of things vndetermined. Such peruerſe diſputes the Apoſtle liked not. 1. Tim. 6. 5.</p>

                  <p>THis deſperation ariſeth, Firſt, vpon ſome ſinne committed againſt God or man, contrary to the cleare light of his reaſon: as <hi>Saul</hi> did againſt <hi>Dauid</hi> by his owne confeſſion, 1. Sam. 24. 16. 17. 21. &amp; 25. 21. In like manner did <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel,</hi> in taking part with <hi>Ahſalom</hi> againſt <hi>Dauid;</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> againſt Chriſt, whom hee acknowledged to bee innocent, vpon the torture of his Conſcience, Matth. 27. 2. Secondly, it commeth vpon the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of ſinne, as thinking it impardonable; that for
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:14165:142"/> it God hath forſaken him, that there is no mercy for him, that he is damned; as within themſelues the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate doe conclude, and doe ſometime vtter as much, as a Sheriffes man did, who mocked and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed one <hi>Iames Abbes</hi> a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin">Act and Monum.</note> Martyr, and as I my ſelfe knew an Atturney, who cryed aloud, I am damned, I am damned, and dyed miſerably.</p>

                  <p>MOſt lamentable is the ſtate of any one in this Caſe, and vnder the power of this deſperate Conſcience; for firſt, it makes a man reſtleſſe and vnquiet; he is full of feares, his ſpirit perplexed, and grieuouſly tormented with apprehenſion of Hell, Death, and Damnation. 2. He can attaine to no ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall comfort: for he ſeeth God againſt him, the Diuell he conceits is ready to take him to him; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beleeue any of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of life to belong at all to him; he hath no part
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:14165:143"/> in heauen, no hope to bee with Chriſt and his Saints; but feareth deſperately Hell and damnation.

               <p>A good Conſcience is that which performeth it offices rightly for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of man.

               <p>The excellency hereof ſtood in theſe things, Firſt, in bearing <hi>Adam</hi> witneſſe that he was good, holy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, righteous, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore happy, and bleſſed. Secondly, in bearing ſway and rule in him, ſo as hee was euery way obedient to Gods will. Thirdly, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting him in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with ioy, without ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or dread of diuine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie.</p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:14165:147"/>
               <p>This was the goodneſſe of his Conſcience then, while he abode in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, harmeleſſe and without ſinne: And this ſhall be the goodneſſe of it when we attaine to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in glory.</p>
               <p>The cauſes hereof were, Firſt, the perfection of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> knowledg, who knew exactly Gods will; and all and euery duty on his part to be performed, to God, to man, and to himſelfe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the perfection of his memorie euer conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and firmely retaining thoſe duties for obſeruing of them; Thirdly, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect freedome of the will, free from all peruerſeneſſe and rebellion; and inclined to all goodneſſe, readily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:14165:148"/> the rule of reaſon and dictate of Conſcience. Fourthly, The hearts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe, with all purity and ſincerity. Laſtly, the affections orderly ſetled, and free from ſenſuality, inconſtancie, diſorder, and exceſſe. Vnruly paſſions bare then no ſway.</p>
               <p>But now ſince the fall, this naturall Conſcience hath loſt it ſoueraigntie in the groſſe vulgars, as well Chriſtian, as heathen, who haue onely ſome common principles but rudely appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, on which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time their Conſcience workes; otherwiſe, for the moſt part, they are led but by ſenſe, or experience, or examples, doing as they ſee others to doe: and are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:14165:148"/> better then brute beaſts, through their ſottiſh igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſauage qualities, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly paſſions, and beaſtly ſenſualitie, doing many things againſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the light of nature it ſelfe, if they would but attend vnto it. For want whereof they feele in a manner no worke of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience at all; ſo farre haue innumerable Pagans, and a numberleſſe number of the ruder ſort, liuing among Chriſtians, and vnder that name moſt vnworthily, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated from the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the naturall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which was in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> The loſſe whereof is to bee bewailed, we are to labour for to repaire it, and to deſire the perfection
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:14165:149"/> thereof in Heauen.</p>

               <p>THe morall good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is that which is exerciſed in and about matters onely of right and wrong, and common ciuill honeſtie. This Conſcience is in two ſorts, of ſome out of the Church, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers within the Church.</p>

                  <p>THere are many out of the Church, which haue
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:14165:149"/> had and yet haue this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Conſcience, Ancient Heathen Philoſophers, and many now among the Turks and Perſians, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ciuilized Nations.</p>
                  <p>How farre theſe may go with this their morall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience commendably, it may appeare by theſe things, Firſt, by ſome wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of morall vertues, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks and politicks, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent well. Secondly, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny golden ſentences diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed here and there in their works. Thirdly, by whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome lawes enacted, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed among them. Fourthly, By praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy examples left recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all poſterities, ſome for iuſtice, ſome for temperance and chaſtitie,

                  <p>THis their morall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is gotten, Firſt, by ciuil education, and by being trained vp in good manners.

                  <p>THere are not a few, which liue in the boſom of the Church, and yet haue no more but a meere ciuil morall Conſcience; ruled according to thoſe common naturall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or ſomewhat better
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:14165:151"/> informed by learning the morall law of the tenne Commandements: beyond the letter whereof they hardly extend their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: but when the ſame is ſupported and countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with cuſtome, opinion, worldly wiſedome, exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of others, great or rich, or reputed men of learning and vnderſtanding.</p>

                  <p>YEt this morall Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is good, firſt, for that it is grounded vpon Gods Law, either written in the heart of naturall men, Rom. 2. 14. 15. or
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:14165:151"/> learned out of the Booke of God. Secondly, becauſe this kind of Conſcience will excuſe a man in ſome acts of moralitie, which is<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 15</note> not diſapproued of God, as we may ſee in <hi>Abimelechs</hi> pleading for himſelf, Gen. 20. 6. and in the young rich man auerring his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law, Matth. 19. 20. of whom it is ſaid, that Chriſt loued him, Mark. 10. 21. Thirdly, Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> legall Conſcience in morall iuſtice, and his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law, which, I ſuppoſe, was comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within that, which hee called a good Conſcience in Act. 23. 1. Fourthly, this morall Conſcience produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth much good for the exerciſe of morall vertues
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:14165:152"/> in mens liuing together in ſocieties, to preſerue iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, equitie, to doe good workes, and to vphold a common peace among them.</p>

                  <p>NEuertheleſſe, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a Moraliſt may lift vp himſelfe, as the young rich Man in the Goſpell did, yet can it not giue him aſſurance of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life; for firſt, the Law cannot bind the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Chriſtian to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue his ſaluation by the Law, becauſe the Law is
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:14165:152"/> weake in this through mans faultineſſe, and the Goſpell teacheth ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another way. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Heathen, wee ſee, haue this morall Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and many vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſons in the church. Thirdly, an excellent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt, in his owne appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, for the loue of the World may leaue Chriſt, as the young man did, Mat. 19. 22. Fourthly, becauſe a morall righteouſnes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exceede the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Scribes and Phariſies; but the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, by which we muſt be ſaued, muſt exceed that, Matth. 5. 20.</p>

Secondly, to make men, which ſeeke not after God aright to glorifie him, to be inexcuſable, Rom. 1. 20. Thirdly, to be conuicted in themſelues, when they wil be bold to ſit downe, and iudge others, Rom. 2. 1. Fourthly, to know Gods iudgement due for ſinne,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:14165:153"/> Rom. 1. 32. Fifthly, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue ſocieties in Families, in Townes, Cities, and Kingdomes: for without this morall Conſcience, men would turne beaſts one againſt another. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to bee a meanes, in the preaching of the Law, to make men to tremble, as <hi>Felix</hi> did, and to mooue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-ſome to ſay with the Iewes and the Gaoler, What ſhall wee doe to bee ſaued? Act. 2. 36. 37. and 16. 30. For without this Conſcience, men would make no vſe, nor haue any regard to the Law at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, but onely as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly they are forced thereunto: as we may ſee in ſuch among vs, vpon whoſe Conſciences the

                  <p>NOw to know a meere Moraliſt, that hath but this morall Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thus they may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They neuer deny themſelues; this precept of the Goſpell they yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer learned: for they are highly conceited of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as was the young Man, Mat. 19. 20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They ſtand much vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their wel-doing, as all Legaliſts doe; both vnto
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:14165:154"/> men, as the prodigall Sons brother did, Luk. 15. 29. ſo likewiſe vnto God, as did the proud Phariſie, Luk. 18. 11. 12.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their ſeruice in the firſt Table to God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vpon a cuſtomarie forme: for they want here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>ſincerity,</hi> not ſtriuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their inbred corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in doing ſeruice to God. They are without <hi>holy zeale,</hi> they doe it not in feruent loue; they are luke-warme, or cold in their Religion; they are not like <hi>Paul</hi> againſt falſe doctrine, Gal. 3. 1. nor like the Paſtor at Epheſus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt falſe Teachers, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel. 2. 1 2. nor like <hi>Moſes</hi> againſt idolatry, Exod. 32. nor like <hi>Nehemiah</hi> againſt
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:14165:155"/> prophanation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, Neh. 13. 17. and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with Idolaters, Verſ. 25. for theſe things the Moraliſt ſhewes neither anger nor ſorrow.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They will not ſuffer for Religion, their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cannot giue them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to endure any triall for their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, diſgrace of the World, loſſe of friends or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, diſcountenance of great perſons, and ſuch like, theſe will make them ſlinke and ſtart aſide.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. All the duties which they doe, are euer ſuch as tend to their owne credit, profit, eſteeme with men, and outward welfare; and are but common duties, ſuch as be praiſe-worthy in
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:14165:155"/> and among commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted honeſt, louing, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Neighbours, keeping themſelues to the letter of the Law: but for the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſenſe, the cauſes, the occaſions, or degrees of ſuch preſcribed duties their conſcience meddles not with. Stricter duties beyond their ſiſe and ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling they mocke at, they call fooliſh preciſeneſſe, and damne the parties for hollow hypocrites. With <hi>Abraham</hi> they inſtruct not their houſhold, Gen. 18. with <hi>Dauid</hi> they caſt not out the wicked from dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with them, Pſal. 101. with <hi>Iob</hi> they pray not dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them; they reſolue not with <hi>Ioſhua</hi> to ſerue God with all their houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:14165:156"/> Ioſh. 24. much leſſe attaine they the praiſe of a pious <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Act. 10. 1. 2.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The euils which they doe abandon, are onely the more groſſer ſorts of euils, ſcandalous among men, ſuch as may bring them vnder the danger of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Lawes, bring vpon them diſgrace with the World, outward ſhame and reproach, puniſhment, loſſe or diſpleaſure with their betters, and ſuch like inducements to preuent their ſinning: but for ſins of another nature, pettie oathes, vaine thoughts of the heart, vnſauourie ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, neglect of houſhold duties, Sabbath-breaking, and the like, the meere Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:14165:156"/> conſcience troubles him not: So that, albeit it be a good Conſcience, in that it is exerciſed about the practiſe of ſome ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and about reſtraining from ſome vices, yet it is not to be reſted vpon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the failings in ſo many things.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. It is reformed, as be all other faculties of the ſoule, in a regenerate man: for Conſcience by ſin was defiled, Tit. 1. 14. and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to be purged and ſanctified. Heb. 9. 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is informed by the mind renewed, which is a better intelligencer then the morall conſcience hath:

                  <p>SO as the effects of it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but bee admirable; For, firſt, it exacts of vs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance to Gods ſeruice, and herein it cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure dead workes, from which it is purged, Heb. 9. 14. ſo as it puts life in vs, and cannot endure to haue vs heare, read, pray, ſing, nor preach, coldly, drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, deadly, nor to reſt vpon the worke wrought. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it requireth vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall obedience, for matter in all things, for time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies. Heb. 13. 18. Act. 23. 1. Thirdly, it diſcouereth vnto our ſelues the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:14165:160"/> and intricate cloſet of the heart; whatſoeuer is ill, it purſueth it, till it worke in the heart deteſtation. Fourthly, it lets not the regenerat man ſlip without a caueat, and remurmurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if he fall, it lets him not reſt but pincheth and nippeth him till hee take knowledge of his ſinne, till he ſee it, ſorrowes for it, and returneth. It cannot endure to haue him ſinke vnder ſinne; nor ſleep ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely till he hath ſought reconciliation with God. Fifthly, If it find him to grow ſlack in good duties, it will euer be telling him of it, it lets him not wax re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe and careleſſe, but by ſtinging inſtigations pricks him forward to his due o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.

                  <p>FIrſt, for the Goſpell is a Law, 1. Chr. 16. 17. Pſal. 105. 10. and called the Law of faith, Rom. 3. 17. now it is the nature of the Law to bind according to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Law-giuer, God himſelfe, whoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is not leſſe in the Law of faith, and his will in the Goſpell, then in that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law.

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:14165:163"/> to it. It commands faith, 1. Ioh. 3. 23. repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Ma. 1. 15. Loue, Ioh. 13. 34. and 18. 12.

                  <p>THe Goſpell doth bind vnto the precepts which it preſcribeth; ſuch are thoſe before mentioned to beleeue, to repent, to loue the brethren, to receiue the holy Sacraments, with the reſt of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Goſpell.

                  <p>VPon the Goſpell thus binding to the Law Euangelically, the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Regenerate is free from the Ceremoniall
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:14165:167"/> Law; becauſe it is bound by the Goſpell to make him ſtand faſt in the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie purchaſed by Chriſt, Gal. 5. 1. who hath aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the law of Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ordinances, Eph. 2. 15. and blotted out the hand-writing of ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt vs, Col. 2. 14. 16.</p>
                  <p>Hence is it, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Regenerate troubles him not about meates, holy dayes, nor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering vp any legall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, Heb. 10. 2.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo quit from the morall Law, in reſpect of the rigorous dominion of it, in reſpect of iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by perſonall fulfilling it, in reſpect of the maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the irritation
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:14165:168"/> thereof, of which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh, Rom. 7. 8.</p>
                  <p>Hence likewiſe it is, firſt, that the Regenerate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cannot vrge vs to the exact fulfilling of the Law, nor can condemne vs for that wee doe not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly in our ſelues fulfill it. Becauſe the Goſpel and Law of faith binds the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate conſcience (as it is regenerate) to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to wit, to witneſſe that we fulfill it in Chriſt, that therefore in him wee cannot bee condemned, Rom. 3. 1. 4. 32 33. for this: but if it accuſe, it accuſeth for want of ſincerity ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and for failings, but cannot condemne vs for not perfectly fulfilling the Law.</p>

                  <p>2. Hence is it, that it vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not iuſtification by workes, nor condemneth vs for not ſo ſeeking to be iuſtified. Becauſe by the Goſpell the Regenerate is bound to caſt off righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by the works of the Law, Gal. 2. 16. and 5. 14.

                  <p>3. Hence is it, that the Regenerate Conſcience doth not condemne the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man for the irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by reaſon of ſinne taking occaſion from the commandement to worke all manner of concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, as it doth in others,

Becauſe the Conſcience of the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate is bound to beare him witneſſe, and ſo doth witneſſe, through the worke of the Spirit by the Goſpell, that after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man hee delighteth in the Law of God, and hath a will to doe it, Rom. 7. 22. Pſal. 1. 2. and 40. 8. that he would doe more good then he can, that he hateth the euill hee doth, Rom. 7. 15. 18. 19. that he hath an vnfeigned reſolution to keepe Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Pſal. 119. 57. 107. and that in ſtudying the Law, by grace receiued from the Goſpell, hee is more delighted in it, and more deſirous to doe it.

                  <p>4.

                  <p>THis before being ſo, and the Conſcience ſo freed by the authoritie of the Goſpell, it may bee deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded here, Why a Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man in his Conſcience is more troubled about his legall omiſſions, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of euill againſt the Law, then for his omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; commiſſions againſt the Goſpell, hee not being

                  <p>To this I anſwer, firſt, Becauſe the law is better knowne then the Goſpell, the one being naturall, the other ſpirituall. Secondly, for that the one is more preſſed vpon Conſcience, and more often laid to heart, then the other. Thirdly, becauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of ſeruile feare ſooner apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth wrath by breach of the Law, then filial feare the obſeruance of dutie from Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercie.

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:14165:172"/> omiſſion of euangelical du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or euils againſt the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, which world lings, and naturaliſts take no notice of. Fifthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the more frequent vſe of the law for morall vertues within, for oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall duties, and offices of loue to be performed one to an other, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with men daily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, wherein a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man findeth his often failings, by reaſon hee knowes the law in a high and ſpirituall ſenſe; Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe Euangelicall precepts, of knowing Chriſt, of belieuing in him, of repenting for ſinne, of Chriſtian loue, do expreſſe themſelues in obſeruing the duties commanded in

                  <p>I anſwer, they differ firſt in the binding power: the vnregenerate onely by the law, as a Naturaliſt, but not by the Goſpell; for it hath no power nor command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his conſcience to work in him obedience, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Firſt, of their ſtrong corruptions not abated.

The vnregenerat mans Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though neuer ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally honeſt, cannot excuſe him, nor witneſſe his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe before God. Rom. 3. 19. 23. But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Conſcience will, by vertue of the Goſpell. The vnregenerate Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cannot witneſſe for the vnregenerate any one of theſe three things, that he liueth in new obedience to God, by Chriſt liuing in him, as the regenerate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will. Gal. 2. 20. That he hath the Spirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the regenerate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth with the aid of Gods ſpirit. Rom. 8. 15.
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:14165:174"/> And that, if he doe feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fall, yet he loueth the Lord; as the regenerate Conſcience in <hi>Peter</hi> will<note place="margin">Ioh. 21. 15.</note> do, after true and heartie repentance. Thirdly, they differ in accuſing. The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate Conſcience in accuſing may driue the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerat from the meanes of ſaluation, as it did the Phariſies, make ſome trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 9.

But now the conſcience of the regene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rate accuſing neuer driueth them from the meanes, the miniſtery of the word, but it worketh reformation, a godly ſorrow in them as it<note place="margin">2.

And thus much for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Conſcience; now follow the many differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, as the tender Conſcience, the wounded Conſcience, the quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the vpright, the pure, the iuſtifying, and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fident Conſcience.</p>

                  <p>THis tender conſcience, ſo rarely to bee found in theſe our daies, hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular effects; Firſt, it makes a man humble in his owne eyes; willing rather to condemne himſelfe for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſinne, then to excuſe, colour, or defend any ſin. Secondly, it makes a man watchfull; for it hath a quick ſight and diligently attendeth vnto the rule, carefully thereby to guide all his actions. It is like the beaſts in Reu. 4. full of eyes before, to preuent ſinne, behind, to recall our ſelues, if any ſinne hath of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:14165:176"/> beene committed. Thirdly, it makes a man fearefull to offend, and therefore moues him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid the very appearance<note place="margin">1.

Scrupuloſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ariſeth vpon an ouer-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitiueneſſe of naturall
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:14165:180"/> wit, inuenting of vnneceſ ſary queſtions, and buſily putting troubleſome caſes to intangle conſcience. The tender Conſcience is from a ſettled mind vpon truths ſoberly receiued, and vpon mature deliberation: Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſitie is from fickleneſſe of ſpirit vpon various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of a mans owne brarne ouer-haſtily appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or vpon other mens opinions raſhly beleeued and ſettled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They differ in the ſubiect matter about which they are exerciſed. A ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſcience, if it bee troubled, it is about neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary duties to God or Man, of concerning themſelues. Scrupuloſitie is buſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout trifles, vnneceſſarie
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:14165:180"/> matters, and more concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning others then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. The tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, if it be vnquiet, it is by reaſon of ſome faire probabilities conceiued in the vnderſtanding, and the caſe very diſputable. Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſitie is diſquieted by coniectures, looſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, bare opinions of others, &amp; in matters which might eaſily bee decided. The tender Conſcience keepes within the bounds of a mans owne Calling; and ſeeth that all bee right there. Scrupuloſitie is ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging abroad, makes a buſie body, and an Intermedler without warrant, while much is amiſſe at home.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They differ in their concomitants. Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:14165:181"/> of Conſcience is euer accompanied with humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, meekeneſſe, peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with ſinceritie, and with charity towards their oppoſites. Scrupuloſity is high-minded, fierce, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient at oppoſition, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting loue to Oppoſites, and is often tainted with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They differ in their effects; for the tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience makes a man to loue peace, to auoide vaine diſputations, and caſting forth vnneceſſary doubts, it hateth alſo ſingularitie, and cannot abide to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious. Scrupuloſitie is contentious, factious; it is fed with diſputes; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in doubtfull caſes, affecteth ſingularity, is
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:14165:181"/> troubleſome, and ouer-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They differ in the end: a tender conſcience aimeth at the pleaſing of God, Rom. 14. 6. and quiet liuing<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 14</note> with others, as much as is poſſible, in holineſſe; being euer loth to trouble o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or to be troubleſome to it ſelfe.

                  <p>AS God ſpeedily eaſeth ſome, ſo he lets other, who haue not fallen ſo fearefully, nor apprehend in ſo violent a manner their offences (though they bee made ſad, and alſo be much perplexed with ſorrow and griefe for ſinne) to lie longer vnder it.

                  <hi>CHAP. 46.</hi> Of the difference betweene the wounded Conſcience and the deſperate Conſcience.</head>
               <p>SEing the effects of a wounded ſpirit in the regenerate are very lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and that ſuch a one may vtter deſperate ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yea more, ſometime become ſo weary of life, as he or ſhee may ſeek their owne death: it may be ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how the deſperate and this do differ?</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is much betweene them in many reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the parties, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Conſcience may befall a <hi>Dauid,</hi> and is the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:14165:201"/> Conſcience of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, though it afflict them ſore: but the deſperate Conſcience happeneth to a <hi>Saul,</hi> a <hi>Iudas:</hi> either to men lewdly vicious, or deeplie hipocrites.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They differ in the cauſes; The deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is from Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to puniſh the wicked; the other is a fatherly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſment of God, and for triall. The deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ariſeth from appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Gods fierce an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and wrath for ſinne, for feare of vengeance, from loſſe, from outward croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſhame, and reproach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men; The other is moſt from the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinne, and want of grace, of which things they
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:14165:202"/> moſt complaine; and more bewaile theſe, then grieue or fret at croſſe, ſhame, diſgrace, or terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; with apprehenſion of Gods heauy indignation, deſperately as others be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They differ in the manner of working, the deſperate is very violent, condemning, damning, and making a man to giue way wholly to the terrours thereof, and to the ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of Satan; for they are wholly vnder the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Law; they haue no part in the ſauing power of the Goſpell; neither haue they any aſſiſtance from God, Iob 8. 20.</p>
               <p>The other is very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, but not ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but reproueth, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:14165:202"/> conuinceth, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mureth euer againſt man; but yet is hee not wholly giuen ouer to the terrour thereof, nor to Satans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious ſuggeſtions. Becauſe they are not vnder the Law, but vnder Grace, their graces alſo do worke as their faith and hope, though but weakely for the preſent; and God doth not vtterly forſake them, Iob 8. 20. neither doth hee ſuffer them to be tempted aboue that which they are able to beare, 1. Cor. 10. 13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They differ in ſome effects: the deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience makes man to ſeeke eaſe, and to get freed from the torture here, if he may; not to change his former

                  </gap>o walke: more carefully in holy duties, and to haue his heart ſet at liberty, to runne more chearefully the way of Gods Commandements.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They differ in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies vſed to cure the griefe. The deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience driues men to vaine company, fooliſh paſtimes, wanton delights, or to thruſt them into worldly
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:14165:205"/> buſineſſes, or to ſeeke help of ill inſtruments, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Wizards, as <hi>Saul</hi> did; or to goe to their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in ſinne, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, but without comfort.</p>
               <p>The afflicted ſpirit is not moued to any of theſe, but flyeth from them, and hateth them; it finds no reſt by worldly vaine, and fleſhly meanes: it therfore ſeekes ſpirituall meanes, godly mens aduiſe, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian conference, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours continually with earneſt deſire to feele com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in a fauourable accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, through faith in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And laſtly they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the end, the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Conſcience workes mans deſtruction, &amp; makes

               </p>
               <p>But the godly, afflicted in conſcience, attaineth to<note place="margin">Pſa. 37. 37.</note> a more happy end, and that is peace after much and long conflict, as examples haue ſhewed.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 47.</hi> Of the difference betweene the afflicted Conſcience, and the paſsion of Melancholy.</head>
               <p>IT is the faſhion of vaine men to iudge the wound
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:14165:206"/> of Conſcience, Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of the one, and not ſo of the other; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their naturall knowledge therefore they fondly iudge of a ſpirituall malady. And for that they may ſometime meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the greater griefe of the aflicted ſpirit, and not diſcerning the one from the other, they raſhly iudge all to be onely a fit of Melancholy, when as they differ much.</p>
               <p>For firſt, the Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like humour workes a ſad penſiueneſſe in ſuch, as bee neuer troubled about caſes of Conſcience, nor euer grieued for ſinne, or failing in religious duties: but the wound of Conſcience
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:14165:207"/> workes heauineſſe of heart for theſe things:</p>
               <p>2. Melancholy filleth the head often with vaine fantaſies and imaginations of ſuch things, as if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had loſt their wits and vnderſtandings, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits being to others ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently falſe and fooliſh. But he that is wounded in ſpirit, loſeth not his right apprehenſion of the iuſt cauſe of ſorrow, neither is he ſo miſtaken in his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination as the other be.</p>
               <p>3. Melancholike paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ariſe from naturall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the body; the other from the ſight of ſinne in the ſoule.</p>
               <p>4. This may bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſcerned by bodily complection, ſo cannot the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:14165:207"/> other: for affliction of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may befall ſuch, whoſe complection is ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

               <p>5. The meere melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike perſon grieueth not for Gods diſhonour, for other mens rebellions againſt God, and becauſe men keepe not Gods Law; hee is not touched with theſe things, as a <hi>Dauid</hi> was, and afflicted ſoules be for their owne ſins, which moueth them to mourne and lament for others.</p>
               <p>6. The melancholy is cured by phyſicke, as being a bodily diſeaſe: but ſo is not the wound of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>7. The melancholike
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:14165:208"/> cured and amended, is not ioyous in the Lord, ſpeaks not of ſpirituall comforts, and peace obtained with God by faith, nor deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the company of the godly, nor in any holy conference with them, nor ſeekes after ſpirituall meanes, nor finds comfort in meditation, hearing and reading of Gods Word, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten praying, and many eia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations vnto God: but the afflicted in Conſcience cured, takes delight in theſe things, and doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe much ioy herein, euen to the reioycing of the hearts of the pious, and religiouſly-minded.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the melancholike humour is neuer ſo cured, but the parties of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:14165:208"/> will eaſily bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaken therewith, either vpon no occaſion, or vpon light croſſes of the world, and diſcontentments, and ſo bee caſt into a ſudden dumpiſhneſſe, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to render a ſound reaſon thereof. But men of wounded conſcience once cured, and their peace ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with God, they are neuer ſad but for ſome new ſinne, or being in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with ſuch as grieue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ſinning; the worlds croſſes may trouble them; but finding inward peace, they are chearefull, or ſoone made chearefull by comfortable conference with religious people. The Melancholike humour and the wound of conſcience

                  <p>The euil quiet Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience ariſeth of ignorance and preſumption of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Chriſt.

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:14165:212"/> their waies; for a man of an ill Conſcience dares not make a diligent ſearch into his ſoule touching his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate betweene God and him, becauſe hee hath not an acquittance to ſhew for his diſcharge.</p>
                  <p>But the quiet good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ariſeth vpon ſound knowledge, from aſſurance of Gods fauour through Chriſt, the ſoule being a dorned with graces, and the life of the man vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; it commeth through a thorow ſearch of his wayes, and an acquittance obtained for a full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of all his debt vnto God.

                  <p n="1">1. To take heed of ſuch things as may ouerthrow it and make vs to loſe it, and they chiefly are theſe three.

Secondly, to maintain iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by workes, and not by faith without the workes of the Law. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to loſe our faith.

                  <p n="2">2. To keepe this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as we muſt take heed of that which may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow it, ſo muſt we be

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:14165:240"/> of comfort from Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this life are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our auoiding of ſin, and maſtery ouer corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: now, in Heauen wee ſhall in this reſpect haue Conſcience to comfort vs; for no vncleane thing ſhall come in there; fleſh and bloud cannot enter into that Kingdome; no more ſinning there, corruption hath put on incorruption; and weake man and ſinfull hath on him there fulneſſe of ſanctitie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our obedience here to Gods law makes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience to comfort vs; much more in Heauen where it ſhall be in ful perfection, euen legal obedience in euery mans perſon then; ſo as there im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſnes by faith

                  <p n="3">3. Our conuerſation, being here ſincere, louing, ſimple, without fraud: which ioyed Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>

                  <p>1. A worme is bred of corruption, ſo comes this Hell-worme of Conſcience
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:14165:243"/> from filthie corrupt luſts within vs. Secondly, a worme lyeth gnawing and griping in the ſtomacke and bowels; ſo this Hell-worme in the ſoule and heart of man. Thirdly, A worme in mouing turneth too and fro, this way, and that way; So this Hell-worme in mouing works torture and pangs now one way, now another: by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tîng ſinnes before them, which is a great plague, Pſal. 50. 21. threatned by the Lord. It was an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and bitterneſſe to <hi>Iobs</hi> ſoule, to be made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member<note place="margin">Iob. 13. 26.</note> the ſinnes of his youth.

Secondly, by applying the deſert of the torments and plagues in Hell, as iuſtly deſerued for ſuch ſinnes. For when they ſeeke for mercy, this Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worme of Conſcience will reply, and ſay as <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Parable, Remember thou tookeſt thy pleaſures, thou gapedſt for profits, didſt hunt after prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nothing could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thee, thou wouldſt be filthy in vncleanneſſe, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, fornication, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe and gluttonie; thou wouldſt oppreſſe, coozen and defraud to get wealth, now art thou tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and tortured, and ſhalt bee. Thirdly, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:14165:244"/> them, when they look vp, and ſee the godly in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, that they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of that happineſſe: becauſe they deſpiſed God, Gods Word, Gods Miniſters, and Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and therefore haue loſt for euer their portion there now; thus this Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worme tormenteth them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a worme that neuer dyeth. Heere wormes in the ſtomacke or belly may be killed, and by Phyſicke auoided; but no meanes to kill this: it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dyeth, but is euer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end tormenting and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting, torturing and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly vexing the damned there.</p>
                  <p>The wofull effects are theſe: They are in reſtleſſe
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:14165:244"/> paine, and ſeeke for eaſe, as the Parable of <hi>Diues</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 24.</note> but now the time of mercy is paſt, and no eaſe in the leaſt degree to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from God: for hee endured their ſinnes; and they muſt now endure his plagues. Secondly, they deſire to die, and to out off their dayes, wiſhing a finall conſumption; but this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee; they once dyed, now they: muſt diue as dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and dyingi yet liue moſt miſerably in vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: torment. Thirdly, they weep and gnaſh their<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 12. &amp; 13. 42.</note> teeth, as ſuch doe as be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with wormes.</p>
                  <p>They weep and lament, and that vpon a foure fold conſideration; firſt, for the loſſe of heauen and that
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:14165:245"/> happineſſe there; iuſt cauſe of ſorrow and lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the loſſe is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualewable; Heauen for Hell; others admitted in,<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 28</note> and they thruſt out; this makes them weepe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, then becauſe of the<note place="margin">Reuel. 21. 8</note> torment, the grawing worme, the flames of fire, in a Lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, a burning ſornace. Thirdly, for that they are with the Diuels and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> their companions in that endleſſe woe. Laſtly, becauſe they cry to God, they cry to the Lord Ieſus, and none will heare nor pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie them; no (if they knew one another) not parents their children, not children their parents, not the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band his wife, nor the wife
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:14165:245"/> her husband would ſhew any pitie; for Ieſus Chriſt will now doe nothing for them. Is not heere cauſe then of weeping and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation?</p>
                  <p>They gnaſh with their teeth; which is a ſigne of anger and extreme impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency<note place="margin">Iob 16. 9.</note> and rage; for they are mad, firſt, againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for being the cauſe of their owne confuſion and damnation, as the Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worme will tell them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, againſt thoſe hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſpirits for inticing them to ſin, for hardening their hearts in ſinning. Thirdly, againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for cauſing, occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, counſelling, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing, and furthering one another in euill: Oh
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:14165:246"/> how many children will curſe their parents for ill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation! Oh how many ſeruants will haue cauſe to curſe their maſters for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting their poore ſoules, and for ſuffering them in wicked courſes! Oh how many people will curſe bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly their blind, or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Paſtors! Oh that men could heare their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, their cries, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wailings, to terrifie vs from ioyning together in wickedneſſe! Let it not ſeeme incredible to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that they will breake into bitter curſes; for if tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment moued patient <hi>Iob</hi> to curſe the day that euer hee<note place="margin">Iob 3.</note> was borne, and bleſſed <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> to breake into curſes;<note place="margin">. 20. 14.</note> as the wicked people will

Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, againſt the godly to ſee them in felicity: this here will make them gnaſh with<note place="margin">Pſa. 112. 10</note> their teeth; they are ſtill ſo full of enuy and hatred againſt them, that then they will be enraged to ſee them bleſſed, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues accurſed. Laſtly, they will rage againſt God, and blaſpheme him, ſo the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wil do, becauſe of their torments; for repent they<note place="margin">Reuel. 16. 9. 11.</note> cannot, neither will they giue glory vnto God.</p>
                  <p>Conſider theſe wofull effects of this Hell-worme hereafter, which now lieth at reſt within thee, that haſt hardened thy heart in
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:14165:247"/> wickedneſſe. Oh betimes, looke to thy Conſcience, make it thy friend, that God may bee alſo thy friend, leſt it become thy foe, and be the Hel-worme among the damned fiends, there to torment thee for euer and euer.</p>
